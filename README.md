# Introduction to Virtual Machines and Vagrant
I learned in this project that there are virtual machines.
Basically, they are simulations of hardware with an environment or an operating system.
Virtual machines are used in many cases and situations in different fields such as development, cybersecurity, and so on.
The main benefit of virtual environments is that they provide isolated containers that can be mobile and replicated, allowing 
developers to enjoy their work without the hassle of dependencies.

Now, this is where Vagrant comes in.
Vagrant is an open-source project created to solve the issue of portability of these environments.
To put it simply, Vagrant makes it straightforward, easy to distribute, and deploy.

As I understood, Vagrant uses "providers," which are basically virtual machine provider containers encapsulated into objects called "boxes" that can be shared.
